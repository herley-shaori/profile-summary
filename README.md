# Profile Summary

This project contains a simple Node.js website for personal branding. The site introduces **Herley**, a cloud computing and data science enthusiast who holds every AWS certification except Advanced Networking.

## Running the site

1. Install Node.js (v14 or later).
2. In this directory run:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

The website is intentionally lightweight, using only Node's built-in modules to serve static HTML and CSS files located in the `public` folder.
